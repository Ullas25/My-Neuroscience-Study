# Fundamentals-of-Neuroscience-Notes
This is my notes of Fundamentals of Neuroscience (3 courses) offered by the **Harvard University** through edX

[Program website](https://www.edx.org/xseries/harvardx-fundamentals-of-neuroscience)

Fundamentals of Neuroscience is a Xseries program offered by the [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/) through [edX.](https://www.edx.org/) Prof. [David Cox](https://www.edx.org/bio/david-cox) is the course instructor. This course is based on the introductory Neurobiology course taught at Harvard. The program covers signal transduction, sensation, perception and the physiology of the brain.The program covers 3 courses:
1. Fundamentals of Neuroscience, Part 1: The Electrical Properties of the Neuron
2. Fundamentals of Neuroscience, Part 2: Neurons and Networks
3. Fundamentals of Neuroscience, Part 3: The Brain

# Computational-Neuroscience-Notes
My notes of Computational Neuroscience course offered by the **University of Washington** through Coursera

[Course website](https://www.coursera.org/learn/computational-neuroscience/home/welcome)

Computational Neuroscience course is offered by the [University of Washigton](https://www.washington.edu/) through [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/). The course instructors are Prof. [Rajesh P. N. Rao](https://www.rajeshpnrao.com/) and Prof. [Adrienne Fairhall](https://pbio.uw.edu/directories/faculty/entry/afairhall/).

The course is an introduction to basic computational methods for understanding nervous system. The recommended textbook for the course is [Theoretical Neuroscience: Computational and Mathematical Modeling of Neural Systems by Laurence F. Abbott and Peter Dayan](http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~lmate/biblio/dayanabbott.pdf). I have uploaded my python solutions to exercise of chapter 1 of this text book, you can find it [here](https://github.com/Ullas25/Theoretical-Neuroscience).

# Medical-Neuroscience
Medical Neuroscience course is offered by the **Duke University** through [Coursera.](https://www.coursera.org/) [ ---***In progess***---]

[Course website](https://www.coursera.org/learn/medical-neuroscience?)

The course instructor is Prof. [Leonard E. White](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/~901314). The course covers Neuroanatomy, Neural Signalling, Sensory Systems, Movement and Motor Control, Brain Development, and Cognition. This is very intensive course. I literally have spent 100s of hours on this course (including recommended text book study). I have to say, this is my favourite and difficult course that I have taken so far. 

Usefull resources for the course:
* [Supporting webpage of the course](https://www.learnmedicalneuroscience.nl/) (You can find all the helpful resources here)
* [Visulizing the brain/virtual lab](http://www.anatomie-amsterdam.nl/sub_sites/anatomie-zenuwwerking/123_neuro/start.htm)
* [Textbook resources](https://learninglink.oup.com/access/neuroscience-sixth-edition-student-resources#tag_chapter-01) - *I highly recoomend you to go over animations. It helps a lot in understanding.*
* [Quiz - text book chapterwise](https://neuroscience5e.sinauer.com/quiz/quiz_chapters.cgi)
