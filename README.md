# My-Neuroscience-Study (*Under Construction*)
This repositiory contains my notes of Fundamentals of Biology, Fundamentals of Neuroscience, Computational Neuroscience and Medical Neuroscience

# Fundamentals-of-Biology [In progress]
Here I upload my notes of fundamentals of biology. 

Courses I have completed and that are in progress are as follows:-
## [**Getting up to Speed in Biology**](https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:OCW+Pre-7.01+1T2020/about)
* It is a preparatory course offered by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). 
* Course instrutors are Prof. Hazel Sive and Dr. Diviya Ray.
* The course covers **cell, molecules, information transfer in biology, inheritence and genetics, Restriction Endonucleases, Cloning and Polymerase Chain Reaction**.
* In addition to materials of the course, I am studying from additional materials like textbooks.

## [Fundamentals of Biology: Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/biology/7-01sc-fundamentals-of-biology-fall-2011/index.htm) Open Courseware Scholar course
* OCW scholar course is designed for mastering foundational subjects at the college level,it provides all the resources you need to learn independently.
* The [course instructors](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/biology/7-01sc-fundamentals-of-biology-fall-2011/syllabus/meet-the-instructors/) are Prof. Eric Lander Prof. Robert Weinberg, Prof. Tyler Jacks, Prof. Hazel Sive, Prof. Graham Walker, Prof. Penny Chisholm and Dr. Michelle Mischke.
* This course covers:
  * **Biochemistry**
  * **Molecular Biology**
  * **Genetics**
  * **Recombinant DNA**

# Fundamentals-of-Neuroscience-Notes
This is my notes of Fundamentals of Neuroscience (3 courses) offered by the Harvard University through edX

[Program website](https://www.edx.org/xseries/harvardx-fundamentals-of-neuroscience)

Fundamentals of Neuroscience is a Xseries program offered by the [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/) through [edX.](https://www.edx.org/) Prof. [David Cox](https://www.edx.org/bio/david-cox) is the course instructor. This course is based on the introductory Neurobiology course taught at Harvard. The program covers signal transduction, sensation, perception and the physiology of the brain.The program covers 3 courses:
1. Fundamentals of Neuroscience, Part 1: The Electrical Properties of the Neuron
2. Fundamentals of Neuroscience, Part 2: Neurons and Networks
3. Fundamentals of Neuroscience, Part 3: The Brain

File discription:
* Certificate of completion Part-1: My certificate of completion of Part-1

# Computational-Neuroscience-Notes
My notes of Computational Neuroscience course offered by the University of Washington through Coursera

[Course website](https://www.coursera.org/learn/computational-neuroscience/home/welcome)

Computational Neuroscience course is offered by the [University of Washigton](https://www.washington.edu/) through [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/). The course instructors are Prof. [Rajesh P. N. Rao](https://www.rajeshpnrao.com/) and Prof. [Adrienne Fairhall](https://pbio.uw.edu/directories/faculty/entry/afairhall/).

The course is an introduction to basic computational methods for understanding nervous system. The recommended textbook for the course is [Theoretical Neuroscience: Computational and Mathematical Modeling of Neural Systems by Laurence F. Abbott and Peter Dayan](http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~lmate/biblio/dayanabbott.pdf). I have uploaded my python solutions to exercise of chapter 1 of this text book, you can find it [here](https://github.com/Ullas25/Theoretical-Neuroscience).

* Computational_Neuroscience_Notes.pdf: It is my scanned notes of Computational Neuroscience course 

# Medical-Neuroscience
This is my notes of Medical Neuroscience course offered by the [Duke University](https://duke.edu/) through [Coursera.](https://www.coursera.org/) [ ---***IN PROGRESS***---]

[Course website](https://www.coursera.org/learn/medical-neuroscience?)

The course instructor is Prof. [Leonard E. White](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/~901314). The course covers Neuroanatomy, Neural Signalling, Sensory Systems, Movement and Motor Control, Brain Development, and Cognition. This is very intensive course. I literally have spent 100s of hours on this course (including recommended text book study). I have to say, this is my favourite and difficult course that I have taken so far. 

Usefull resources for the course:
* [Supporting webpage of the course](https://www.learnmedicalneuroscience.nl/) (You can find all the helpful resources here)
* [Visulizing the brain/virtual lab](http://www.anatomie-amsterdam.nl/sub_sites/anatomie-zenuwwerking/123_neuro/start.htm)
* [Textbook resources](https://learninglink.oup.com/access/neuroscience-sixth-edition-student-resources#tag_chapter-01) - *I highly recoomend you to go over animations. It helps a lot in understanding.*
* [Quiz - text book chapterwise](https://neuroscience5e.sinauer.com/quiz/quiz_chapters.cgi)

File discription:
As GitHb only allows to upload <= 25mb/file , I had to upload my scanned notes in parts. My notes are names as ***Part_(part_number)_Medical_Neuroscience_Notes***.

*Note: I will be uploading the remaining notes in the days to come.*
